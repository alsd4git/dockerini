## Introduction

Portainer is a powerful container management tool that simplifies Docker container deployment. This repository aims to provide a collection of Docker Compose stacks for various services and applications, making it easy to deploy and manage these containers using Portainer.

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need to have Docker and Portainer installed on your system. If you haven't already set up Portainer, please follow the official [Portainer installation guide](https://www.portainer.io/installation).

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alsd4git/dockerini.git
```

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into folders, with each folder representing a specific Portainer stack. This modular structure helps maintain an organized and clean layout for your Docker Compose files.

Here's an example of the folder structure:

```markdown
- /stack1
  - docker-compose.yml
  - .env
  - /resources
    - ... (files and directories specific to this stack)
- /stack2
  - docker-compose.yml
  - .env
  - /resources
    - ... (files and directories specific to this stack)
- /stack3
  - docker-compose.yml
  - .env
  - /resources
    - ... (files and directories specific to this stack)
```

Each stack folder should contain the following elements:

- docker-compose.yml: The Docker Compose file for the specific service or application.
- .env: An environment file containing necessary configuration settings, such as API keys, passwords, and other environment variables.
- /resources: A directory for any additional resources or configuration files needed for the stack.

## Usage

1. Navigate to the specific stack folder you want to deploy.

2. Customize the `.env` file with your specific configuration settings.

3. Deploy the stack using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
